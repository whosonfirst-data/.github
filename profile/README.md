## Data

Unless otherwise noted Who's On First data records are stored in repositories grouped in to one of four namespaces. It would be nice to imagine that we could put _all_ the Who's On First data records in to a single Git repository but that is still not possible to do efficiently yet.

### whosonfirst-data-admin

[Administrative records](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data?q=whosonfirst-data-admin), ranging from microhoods to continents, grouped by country (and identified by their two-letter country code). For example all the Who's On First records for Mexico are grouped in to the [whosonfirst-data-admin-mx](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-admin-mx) repository.

### whosonfirst-data-postalcode

[Postal code records](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data?q=whosonfirst-data-postalcode) grouped by country (and identified by their two-letter country code). For example all the Who's On First records for Great Britain are grouped in to the [whosonfirst-data-postalcode-gb](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-postalcode-gb/) repository.

### whosonfirst-data-venue

[Venue records](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data?q=whosonfirst-data-venue) grouped by country (and identified by their two-letter country code). For example all the Who's On First records for Canada are grouped in to the [whosonfirst-data-venue-ca](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-venue-ca/) repository.

Because there are so many venue records for the United States, they have been further subdivided in to per-state groupings identified by their two-letter state code. For example all the Who's On First records for California are grouped in to the [whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ca](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ca/) repository.

### whosonfirst-external

Who's On First data associated with [external data sources](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data?q=whosonfirst-external). Unless otherwise noted these are grouped by external source, placetype and two-letter country code. For example, Who's On First ancestry data (parent ID and hierarchy) for Foursquare venues in Australia are grouped in to the [whosonfirst-external-foursquare-venue-au](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-external-foursquare-venue-au) repository.
